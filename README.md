### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ronel. I am a Senior student at Oakland University pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Information Technology with a concentration in Cybersecurity. As a student, I have taken numerous courses in different programming languages, understanding cybersecurity concepts, working on networking concepts, and much more. I work very professionally and well on multiple projects with different groups, along with working individually throughout the different courses that I've taken so far. Feel free to see my work through my GitHub repository!
